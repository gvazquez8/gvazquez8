# About Me

I'm a software engineer primarily building windows applications! I've built features for Microsoft and Google and I've been working hard to find my place in the programing world 👨‍💻!
Gaming has been an integral aspect of my life, helping me through tough times and also blessing me with amazing stories that I can dissociate into.
Lately, I've been watching X-Files 👽, playing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 🥖, Factorio 🏭, and playing some indie games!
I hope to contribute to society in ways that can improve people's lives in meaninful ways!
